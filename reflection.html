    <h2>Pre:</h2>
    <p>Before I got involved in any professional development activities this semester, I felt pretty unsure about how to
        prepare for life after graduation. My resume was basic and poorly put together, and I had no real idea how to
        present myself to employers. Graduate programs felt like a black box—I didn’t know how they worked or what the
        application process looked like, and that made the future feel pretty overwhelming. I honestly just didn’t know
        where to start when it came to building a professional identity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the semester, I took part in a range of activities—career expos, employer info sessions, and workshops on
        topics like resume writing and cultural intelligence. One of the most eye-opening things was learning about AI
        resume screening tools, which are now a major part of the hiring process. The presentations from Boeing and
        Macquarie Bank opened my eyes to career options I hadn’t considered before, and the seminar on the Chinese job
        market gave me insights that felt especially relevant to my background.
        These experiences really shifted my mindset around career development. I now know how to write a resume that
        highlights my strengths and is more likely to make it through automated systems. I’ve found ways to work around
        my limited work experience—like starting a GitHub portfolio, looking into virtual internships, and working
        toward certifications. Most importantly, I feel a lot more confident about moving from student life into the
        professional world. I have a clearer sense of what I want and how to start working toward it.

    <h2>Post:</h2>
    <p>Over the course of this semester, I took part in several professional development activities that really changed
        how I approach my career preparation. Two experiences in particular had a big impact on how I see my
        employability skills and future opportunities. I’ll use the STAR L/P model to reflect on what I learned and how
        it’s helped me grow.

    <p>
        <b><i>Experience 1: FDM Resume Optimization Workshop</i></b>
    </p>
    <p><b>Situation</b>: As a computer science student with limited work experience, I wasn’t confident in how to
        present
        myself to potential employers. My resume was underwhelming and didn’t reflect my capabilities well. On top of
        that, I didn’t really understand how modern recruitment works.</p>
    <p><b>Task</b>: I joined the FDM Resume Optimization Workshop to get better at writing a competitive resume and
        learn how
        recruiters actually assess applications.</p>
    <p><b>Action</b>: During the session, I paid close attention to tips on layout, how to use keywords effectively, and
        ways
        to showcase transferable skills—even from non-work experiences. I also learned about Applicant Tracking Systems
        (ATS), which scan resumes before a human even looks at them.</p>
    <p><b>Result</b>: After the workshop, I revamped my resume completely. I added industry-specific keywords, made the
        formatting ATS-friendly, and rewrote my project descriptions to include more specific results and metrics.</p>
    <p><b>Learning</b>: This experience helped me realize that a strong resume isn’t just about listing
        qualifications—it’s
        also about formatting and language that work with AI screening tools. I also saw how projects and volunteer work
        can be presented in a way that shows real value to employers.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Planning</b>: Moving forward, I’ll keep a “master” resume with all my experiences, so I can tailor it to
        different
        job roles. I also plan to build a GitHub portfolio to showcase my technical skills more clearly and provide
        evidence of what I can do beyond what's on paper.

    <p><b><i>Experience 2: Chinese Job Market Seminar</i></b></p>
    <p><b>Situation</b>: As a Chinese international student, I’ve thought about returning to China after graduation, but
        I
        didn’t know much about the job market or how international graduates are viewed by employers there.</p>
    <p><b>Task</b>: I attended a seminar aimed at helping Chinese students understand job opportunities, recruitment
        timelines,
        and application expectations back home</p>
    <p><b>Action</b>: I took notes on hiring trends, high-demand tech sectors, and how resumes are typically structured
        in
        China. I also asked questions about how international education is perceived and what technical qualifications
        are most valued.</p>
    <p><b>Result</b>: I came away with a much clearer picture of how hiring works in China. I learned that resumes there
        follow
        different formats and that certifications are often a bigger focus than in Western hiring practices.</p>
    <p><b>Learning</b>: This opened my eyes to the importance of tailoring my job search based on regional expectations.
        I
        realized that my international education can be both a strength and a challenge, depending on how I present it.
    <p><b>Planning</b>: I plan to develop a Chinese-format resume and build a professional presence on platforms like
        WeChat.
        I’ll also look into certifications that are highly regarded in China’s tech industry to boost my chances of
        success if I decide to return.</p>

    <h2></h2>
    <p><b>Impact on Personal and Professional Development</b></p>
    <p>These experiences have completely reshaped how I think about career preparation. I used to believe that doing
        well in university was enough, but now I understand that employability is about much more—it includes how I
        present myself, how adaptable I am, and how I position myself for different opportunities.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest changes for me has been in confidence. Learning how recruiters think and what tools they use
        gave me a sense of control over my job search. I no longer see my lack of formal work experience as a dead
        end—it’s something I can work around with the right approach.</p>
    <p>I’ve also broadened my perspective. Instead of focusing only on local jobs, I’m now open to international
        opportunities, and I understand the need to adapt to different job markets. This flexibility makes me more
        prepared for a global career.</p>
    <p>Finally, I’ve adopted a more proactive mindset. I’m not waiting until graduation to start my career planning—I’m
        already building my resume, developing my skills, and making professional connections. The biggest takeaway for
        me is that career development isn’t a one-time thing. It’s ongoing, and every project, workshop, or new
        challenge is a chance to grow and get closer to my goals.</p>

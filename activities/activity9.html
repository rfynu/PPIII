                <h3>Activity Description</h3>
                <p>Cognizant hosted an "AI for Impact" seminar focused on applying artificial intelligence for public good and social impact. The seminar showcased how Cognizant's AI Labs and other initiatives are working to develop AI solutions that address real-world challenges in healthcare, education, environmental conservation, and underserved communities.</p>
                
                <p>The seminar covered several key areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Case studies of AI applications that have created positive social impact</li>
                    <li>Cognizant's approach to "Engineering Impact for Good" through technology</li>
                    <li>Ethical considerations in developing AI for public benefit</li>
                    <li>Multi-agent AI systems for complex decision-making in social contexts</li>
                    <li>Collaboration models between technology companies, academia, and public sector</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>The seminar provided valuable insights into how AI is being applied for societal benefit:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>AI can address complex societal challenges when developed with intentional focus on social impact</li>
                    <li>Responsible AI development requires consideration of ethical implications throughout the entire lifecycle</li>
                    <li>Effective AI solutions for public good often integrate multiple AI approaches (generative AI, deep learning, evolutionary AI)</li>
                    <li>Partnerships between technology providers, academic institutions, and community organizations maximize impact</li>
                    <li>AI specialists increasingly need to develop expertise in specific domains (healthcare, education, etc.) to create relevant solutions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Relevance to My Professional Development</h3>
                <p>As a computer science student this seminar opened my eyes to career pathways that combine technical expertise with social impact. Beyond traditional tech roles, I learned about opportunities to apply AI skills in socially meaningful contexts.</p>
                
                <p>The presenters emphasized that tomorrow's AI professionals will need not only technical proficiency but also interdisciplinary knowledge and ethical awareness. This insight has influenced my course selection strategy, encouraging me to consider electives that provide exposure to different domains where AI can make a positive difference.</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, learning about Cognizant's "AI for Good" projects has inspired me to explore internship opportunities with companies that prioritize social impact alongside technological innovation. The seminar reinforced that my computer science skills can be applied to create meaningful solutions for society's most pressing challenges.</p>

                <h3>Activity Description</h3>
                <p>This specialized seminar was designed specifically for Chinese international students considering returning to China for employment after graduation. The session was presented by career consultants with expertise in the Chinese job market and featured insights from employers who actively recruit international graduates.</p>
                
                <p>The seminar covered several key areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current composition and trends in the Chinese job market</li>
                    <li>How international graduates are perceived by Chinese employers</li>
                    <li>Top hiring sectors and companies in China for 2025</li>
                    <li>Salary expectations across different industries</li>
                    <li>Application timelines and procedures for major graduate programs</li>
                    <li>Chinese resume formatting preferences and standards</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>The seminar provided valuable insights specific to the Chinese employment landscape:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Technology, AI in specific, is currently the fastest-growing sector for graduate recruitment in China</li>
                    <li>Chinese employers value international education but expect returning graduates to demonstrate understanding of local business practices</li>
                    <li>Chinese resumes differ significantly, emphasizing educational background and technical skills over extracurricular activities</li>
                    <li>The recruitment cycle in China typically begins earlier than in Australia, with many applications opening in September-October</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Relevance to My Professional Development</h3>
                <p>As a Chinese student studying computer science, this seminar was particularly relevant to my career planning. It provided me with a clearer understanding of how my international education would be perceived if I choose to return to China, and what additional steps I might need to take to be competitive in the local job market.</p>
                
                <p>The information about resume formatting preferences was especially valuable, as I learned that I would need to create a substantially different version of my resume for Chinese employers. The emphasis on technical certifications and specific skills alignments with job descriptions will influence how I present my qualifications.</p>
                
                <p>Understanding the recruitment timelines for major Chinese tech companies also allows me to better plan my job search strategy, ensuring I don't miss application deadlines if I decide to pursue opportunities in China. This knowledge gives me more flexibility in my post-graduation planning and expands my potential employment options beyond the Australian market.</p>

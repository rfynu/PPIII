                <h3>Activity Description</h3>
                <p>This information session provided detailed overviews of three significant professional development programs offered by the university:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Adelaide Graduate Award</strong> - A program recognizing extracurricular activities and skills development</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Intelligence Program</strong> - Workshops and activities designed to develop cross-cultural competencies</li>
                    <li><strong>Career Mentoring Program</strong> - A structured mentorship initiative pairing students with industry professionals</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Each program was presented by a coordinator who explained the eligibility requirements, application process, time commitment, and potential benefits. After the presentations, there was a Q&A session where students could ask specific questions about each program.</p>
                
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>The session provided valuable insights into the various professional development opportunities available:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The Adelaide Graduate Award requires accumulating points through various activities and reflections</li>
                    <li>The Cultural Intelligence Program offers both short workshops and an extended program</li>
                    <li>The Career Mentoring Program matches students with industry professionals based on career interests and goals</li>
                    <li>Each program requires different time commitments and offers distinct benefits</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Relevance to My Professional Development</h3>
                <p>I was particularly interested in the Career Mentoring Program as it offered the opportunity to be paired with an experienced professional who could share valuable insights and advice about entering the job market. Having access to someone who has navigated the early career challenges in my field seemed like an invaluable resource.</p>
                
                <p>The prospect of receiving personalised guidance on resume building, interview preparation, industry expectations, and workplace culture from someone with first-hand experience was extremely appealing. Additionally, the potential to build a professional relationship that could extend beyond the formal program period added significant value.</p>
                
                <p>Immediately after the session, I applied for the Career Mentoring Program, recognizing it as an opportunity to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations. I felt this would be particularly beneficial as I approach graduation and begin applying for my first professional position.</p>

                <h3>Activity Description</h3>
                <p>Macquarie Bank hosted a virtual information session to present their graduate program opportunities. Representatives from the bank provided an overview of the application process, program structure, and various rotations available within the bank.</p>
                
                <p>The session covered:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Application deadlines and key dates for the upcoming intake</li>
                    <li>Program structure, including rotation options across different business units</li>
                    <li>Eligibility criteria, emphasising that applications are welcome from all disciplines</li>
                    <li>Assessment process and what to expect during each stage</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>While much of the information presented could be found on their website, the session provided some valuable insights:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The specific qualities and skills Macquarie values in graduate candidates</li>
                    <li>Insights into the corporate culture at Macquarie</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Relevance to My Professional Development</h3>
                <p>As a computer science student with electives in finance, this session was particularly informative for my career planning. It helped me understand how my technical skills could be applied in a financial institution and what additional knowledge I might need to develop.</p>
                
                <p>The presentation highlighted the growing importance of technology in financial services and how roles are increasingly intersecting between these domains.</p> 
                <p>I gained a clearer understanding of the recruitment timeline for graduate programs in the banking sector, which typically open applications much earlier than other industries. This knowledge will help me plan my job search more effectively in my final year.</p>

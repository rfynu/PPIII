                <h3>Activity Description</h3>
                <p>FDM Group hosted an online resume optimization seminar designed to provide insights into how employers evaluate resumes during the recruitment process. The session was conducted by FDM's recruitment specialists who shared their expertise on creating effective resumes for the modern job market.</p>
                
                <p>The workshop covered several key areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preferred resume formats, layouts, and fonts for maximum readability</li>
                    <li>Average time recruiters spend reviewing each resume (typically 6-30 seconds)</li>
                    <li>Resume sections that employers focus on most: experience, education, skills, extracurricular activities</li>
                    <li>How Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and AI tools filter resumes before human review</li>
                    <li>Common mistakes that lead to automatic rejection</li>
                    <li>Strategies for tailoring resumes to specific job descriptions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>The workshop provided valuable insights into modern resume screening processes:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Most medium and all large companies now use AI-powered ATS to pre-screen resumes before human review</li>
                    <li>These systems scan for specific keywords related to the job description and required skills</li>
                    <li>Including relevant technical terms (programming languages, tools, methodologies) significantly improves chances of passing AI filters</li>
                    <li>Quantifiable achievements and metrics are more impactful than general descriptions</li>
                    <li>Experience sections should be structured with action verbs and concrete outcomes</li>
                    <li>Extracurricular activities and part-time jobs demonstrate valuable soft skills like time management and teamwork</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Relevance to My Professional Development</h3>
                <p>This workshop was particularly valuable as I prepare to enter the job market. The most significant takeaway was understanding how AI resume scanning tools work and how to optimize my resume to pass these initial filters. Learning that I need to strategically incorporate keywords related to my technical skills and experience has fundamentally changed my approach to resume writing.</p>
                
                <p>I now understand the importance of customizing my resume for each application to match the specific terminology used in job descriptions. This includes explicitly listing programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies that I'm familiar with, rather than using general descriptions.</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, learning that employers value part-time work and extracurricular activities has encouraged me to include these experiences on my resume, highlighting the transferable skills I've developed. This workshop has provided me with concrete strategies to make my resume more competitive in a job market where the first round of screening is increasingly automated.</p>

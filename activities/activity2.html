                <p>First, it provided practical experience in networking and professional communication in a real-world setting. I was able to practice introducing myself and discussing my skills and goals with industry representatives, which helped build my confidence in professional interactions.</p>
                
                <p>Second, seeing the range of companies and roles available gave me a broader perspective on potential career paths within my field. Even if the information wasn't entirely new, seeing the various options represented in one place helped clarify my thinking about which directions might be most suitable for me.</p>
                
                <p>Lastly, the experience reinforced the importance of doing thorough research before such events and preparing targeted questions that go beyond surface-level information. This is a valuable lesson in making the most of networking opportunities throughout my career.</p>
